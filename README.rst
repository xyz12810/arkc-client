ArkC-Client V0.4
================

ArkC is a lightweight proxy designed to be proof to IP blocking measures
and offer high proxy speed via multi-connection transmission and
swapping connections.

ArkC-Client is the client-side utility. In a LAN environment, it either
works with UPnP-enabled routers or requires NAT configuration if the
client is behind a router.

Note: ArkC 0.4 is not compatible with earlier versions.

What is ArkC?
-------------

[To be updated with the new GAE trick!]

ArkC enables VPS owners to share their VPS to people around them, or share online, the proxy hosted on their VPS, without worrying about IP blacklists.

For a more detailed description, please visit our website and read our page `Understand ArkC <https://arkc.org/understand-arkc/>`__. 中文版本的介绍在这一页面 `ArkC的原理 <https://arkc.org/understand_arkc_zh_cn/>`__。

This is what it tries to do by default:

And making it a little bit more complicated, e.g. set obfs_level to 3 or use a socks proxy:

Setup and Requirement
---------------------

For a probably more detailed guide: `Deployment and Installation <https://arkc.org/12-2/deployment-and-installation/>`__. 对于安装与部署的中文说明在 `部署与安装ArkC <https://arkc.org/12-2/deployment_install_zh_cn/>`__
这一页面。

For Windows users, you are recommended to use our Windows GUI, installer along with latest ArkC client binary executable, in the Github `release page <https://github.com/projectarkc/arkc-client-GUI-dotnet/releases/latest>`__. Just pick your .Net Framework version and download.

For users with python3 pip development environment (Note: We don't
recommend using python 2):

::

    sudo pip3 install arkcclient

To install python3 and pip3 with python.h:

Debian/Ubuntu users

::

    sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip python3-dev

Fedora users

::

    yum install python3 python3-devel python3-pip

You may also install ArkC via source.

To get ArkC Client work, you must satisfy ONE OF the following
conditions (unless you are the expert): 1) connect to public Internet
directly 2) connect to the Internet via a UPnP-enabled router, in a
single-layer LAN 3) router(s) on your route to the public Internet are
properly configured with NAT to allow your server to connect to your
client's "remote\_port" directly.

If you need to use portable proxy function, like MEEK (required to integrate with GAE) or obfs4proxy, please follow the above link to arkc.org.

Usage
-----

For detailed documentation, please visit our `Documentation page <https://arkc.org/documentation/>`__.

中文版本的使用文档，请参见 `如何使用ArkC <https://arkc.org/documentation_zh_cn/>`__。

Run

::

    arkcclient [-g] [-h] [-v|-vv] [-pn] -c <Path of the config Json file>

[-pn] is used to disable UPnP.

[-g] makes ArkC work on GAE mode and use a GAE application as the server.

In this version, any private certificate should be in the form of PEM
without encryption, while any public certificate should be in the form
of ssh-rsa.

We could generate a keypair with

::

    arkcclient -kg [--kg-path Key_Generated_Path]

And the keys can be sent to an email address used by the server provider with this command    

::

    arkcclient -reg Email_Address_to_send

Automatically the server should add the key to its key storage.

For the configuration file, you can find an example here:

::

    {
        "local_cert":"client.pem",
        "remote_cert":"server.pub",
        "local_cert_pub":"client.pub",
        "control_domain":"testing.arkc.org",
        "dns_servers": [
                ["8.8.8.8", 53],
                ["127.0.0.1", 9000]
             ]
    }

+--------------------+---------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------+

Note: if obfs\_level is set, pt\_exec must be appropriate set. It is set
to use obfs4 or MEEK, both Tor pluggable transport (abbr: PT). MEEK is
like GoAgent, and obfs4 is used to obfuscate all the traffic.

If set to 1 or 2, Obfs4 will use an IAT mode of (obfs\_level + 1), which
means if obfs\_level is set to 1 or 2, the connection speed may be
affected.

If obfs\_level is set to 3, MEEK will be used to transmit all data via a
pre-configured MEEK service at the server side. By default it passes
through Google App Engine.

Build on Windows into executable
--------------------------------

::

    pip install pyinstaller
    pyinstaller [--onefile] main.py
